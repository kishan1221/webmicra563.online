      <p>
        A Printer is an electromechanical device that accepts text and graphical data from a computer and generates the
        information into a physical form. By knowing what type of printer you have, you will also be able to understand
        how it works. It is broadly categorized into two (2) the Impact and Non-impact.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Impact Printers -</b> are printers in which a key makes contact with an inked ribbon to mark the paper.The
        following are examples of Impact printers.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Daisy wheel –</b> This type of printer works very similar to typewriters. The heart of these printers is a
        circular mechanism known as daisy wheel since it looks like a daisy and numeric characters, symbols and texts
        are molded on each petal on the circumference of the circle. With the help of a servo motor, the daisy wheel
        rotates rapidly and pauses to allow the printing hammer to strike a “petal” containing a character against the
        ribbon producing a print on the paper. Daisy Wheel Printers speed is slow typically 25-55 characters per second.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Dot matrix –</b> Dot matrix printer uses a print head that contains 9 to 24 pins that produces patterns of
        dots to form individual characters. The pins moves back and forth or up and down motion and prints by impact,
        striking an inked ribbon. This printer, determined by the number of pins can produce a much better print quality
        with a speed that can vary from 50 to 500 characters per second. Dot matrix printers can print to multi-page
        forms that something laser or inkjet printers cannot do.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Chain – </b>Like the word chain, a chain printer has a set of numbers and characters arranged in a
        continuous loop that resembles a chainsaw blade. A circuit inside the printer detects if a correct character
        appears, then a row of hammers strike the page, pressing the paper against a ribbon. The chain keeps rotating
        until everything is printed. It is faster than a dot matrix printer which it speeds up to several hundred lines
        per minute.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Non-impact Printers -</b> are printers that do not use a striking device in order to print and they are much
        quieter than the impact printers. These are some of non-impact printers.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Ink-jet – </b> Ink-jet printers produce a high quality graphics and texts. It works the same as dot matrix
        printers which the characters are formed with little dots, but instead of using inked ribbon, an ink-jet printer
        sprays ink at a sheet of paper. Depending on the nature of the hard copy, an inkjet printer can produce up to
        several hundred pages until the ink runs out. Because of its inexpensiveness and satisfactory performance, it is
        much popular for personal computer users.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Laser –</b> A laser printer uses the same technology as photocopy machines. It produces a very high quality
        text and graphics. A laser beam is directed at a mirror which bounces the beam on a light-sensitive drum. This
        light-sensitive drum has a special coating on it which attracts toner or an ink powder. The toner is then
        transferred to the paper printing the letters or graphics and a hot roller bonds them together.

      <h2>How Printers Work</h2>
      <p>
        Printers are devices that accept text and graphic output from a computer and transfer the information to paper,
        usually to standard size sheets of paper. Most printers today are either inkjet or laser printers.

        Inkjet printers spray tiny droplets of ink directly onto the paper. They're best for photos and detailed color
        work. Laser printers use a laser beam to produce an image on a drum, which is then transferred to paper using
        toner and heat — ideal for high-speed, high-volume printing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The printer also includes auto duplex printing, quiet mode for silent operation, and AI-assisted diagnostics to
        automatically notify
        users of maintenance needs. Trusted by over 50,000 businesses worldwide.

                                            with a speed that can vary from 50 to 500 characters per second. Dot matrix printers can print to multi-page
                                            forms that something laser or inkjet printers cannot do.

                                            <b> Chain – </b>Like the word chain, a chain printer has a set of numbers and characters arranged in a
                                            continuous loop that resembles a chainsaw blade. A circuit inside the printer detects if a correct character
                                            appears, then a row of hammers strike the page, pressing the paper against a ribbon. The chain keeps rotating
                                            until everything is printed. It is faster than a dot matrix printer which it speeds up to several hundred lines
                                            per minute.

                                            quieter than the impact printers. These are some of non-impact printers.

                                            sprays ink at a sheet of paper. Depending on the nature of the hard copy, an inkjet printer can produce up to
                                            several hundred pages until the ink runs out. Because of its inexpensiveness and satisfactory performance, it is

                                            light-sensitive drum has a special coating on it which attracts toner or an ink powder. The toner is then

                                          <h2>How Printers Work</h2>
                                          <p>
                                            Printers are devices that accept text and graphic output from a computer and transfer the information to paper,
                                            usually to standard size sheets of paper. Most printers today are either inkjet or laser printers.

                                            Inkjet printers spray tiny droplets of ink directly onto the paper. They're best for photos and detailed color
                                            work. Laser printers use a laser beam to produce an image on a drum, which is then transferred to paper using
                                            toner and heat — ideal for high-speed, high-volume printing.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            The printer also includes auto duplex printing, quiet mode for silent operation, and AI-assisted diagnostics to
                                            automatically notify
                                            users of maintenance needs. Trusted by over 50,000 businesses worldwide.

                                            A Printer is an electromechanical device that accepts text and graphical data from a computer and generates the
                                            information into a physical form. By knowing what type of printer you have, you will also be able to understand
                                            how it works. It is broadly categorized into two (2) the Impact and Non-impact.
                                            <br>

                                            <b>Impact Printers -</b> are printers in which a key makes contact with an inked ribbon to mark the paper.The
                                            following are examples of Impact printers.

                                            <b> Daisy wheel –</b> This type of printer works very similar to typewriters. The heart of these printers is a
                                            circular mechanism known as daisy wheel since it looks like a daisy and numeric characters, symbols and texts
                                            are molded on each petal on the circumference of the circle. With the help of a servo motor, the daisy wheel
                                            rotates rapidly and pauses to allow the printing hammer to strike a “petal” containing a character against the
                                            ribbon producing a print on the paper. Daisy Wheel Printers speed is slow typically 25-55 characters per second.

                                          <p>
                                            <b> Dot matrix –</b> Dot matrix printer uses a print head that contains 9 to 24 pins that produces patterns of
                                            dots to form individual characters. The pins moves back and forth or up and down motion and prints by impact,
                                            striking an inked ribbon. This printer, determined by the number of pins can produce a much better print quality
                                            with a speed that can vary from 50 to 500 characters per second. Dot matrix printers can print to multi-page
                                            forms that something laser or inkjet printers cannot do.

                                          <p>
                                            <b> Chain – </b>Like the word chain, a chain printer has a set of numbers and characters arranged in a
                                            continuous loop that resembles a chainsaw blade. A circuit inside the printer detects if a correct character
                                            appears, then a row of hammers strike the page, pressing the paper against a ribbon. The chain keeps rotating
                                            until everything is printed. It is faster than a dot matrix printer which it speeds up to several hundred lines
                                            per minute.
                                            <br>

                                            <b>Non-impact Printers -</b> are printers that do not use a striking device in order to print and they are much
                                            quieter than the impact printers. These are some of non-impact printers.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>

                                            <b> Ink-jet – </b> Ink-jet printers produce a high quality graphics and texts. It works the same as dot matrix
                                            printers which the characters are formed with little dots, but instead of using inked ribbon, an ink-jet printer
                                            sprays ink at a sheet of paper. Depending on the nature of the hard copy, an inkjet printer can produce up to
                                            several hundred pages until the ink runs out. Because of its inexpensiveness and satisfactory performance, it is
                                            much popular for personal computer users.

                                            <b>Laser –</b> A laser printer uses the same technology as photocopy machines. It produces a very high quality
                                            text and graphics. A laser beam is directed at a mirror which bounces the beam on a light-sensitive drum. This
                                            light-sensitive drum has a special coating on it which attracts toner or an ink powder. The toner is then
                                            transferred to the paper printing the letters or graphics and a hot roller bonds them together.

                                          <h2>How Printers Work</h2>
                                          <p>
                                            Printers are devices that accept text and graphic output from a computer and transfer the information to paper,
                                            usually to standard size sheets of paper. Most printers today are either inkjet or laser printers.

                                            Inkjet printers spray tiny droplets of ink directly onto the paper. They're best for photos and detailed color
                                            work. Laser printers use a laser beam to produce an image on a drum, which is then transferred to paper using
                                            toner and heat — ideal for high-speed, high-volume printing.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            The printer also includes auto duplex printing, quiet mode for silent operation, and AI-assisted diagnostics to
                                            automatically notify
                                            users of maintenance needs. Trusted by over 50,000 businesses worldwide.
